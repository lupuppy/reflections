How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Point out the area that contains the error, hence I donâ€™t have to look through the whole document.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can easily retrieve information from any version of the document, make comparisons of my changes or restore to my former versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    I have control over different versions, so those commits are neither too big nor too small.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    They serve different users. Git mostly serve developers who have files that link together toward one project. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

   git log - view history of all changes; git diff - compare the change of the selected file to the previous one

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
